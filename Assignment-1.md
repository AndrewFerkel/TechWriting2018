# Topic Submission for Assignment 1

## Topic: How to Start a Food Blog
--------
My topic for assignment 1 is an instructional document on how to start a food blog. Included in the document will be how to choose a host site, how to create a logo and banner for the blog, how to research topics, how to properly cite topics, and how to increase traffic to the blog. Supplemental information may include why to start a food blog, a link to a few host sites, and perhaps some pictures to better explain the process. 

The instructional will be focused on an audience of newcomers to blogging, perhaps students who are assigned to make a blog for a class as I was. I believe this instructional document will be complex enough to meet length requirements, but will be easily explained without writing the great American novel on the subject. 

Thank you!
