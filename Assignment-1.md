# How to Start a Food Blog

## Writing an informational blog about food for academic purposes
--------
## Introduction
Considering the technologically driven world that we live in today, it should be of no surprise that people generally rely upon the internet to get most of their information. This fact can be frustrating for health and nutrition professionals, as many of their clients would rather trust the results of an internet search rather than the professional themselves. However, a client's love of the internet can be leveraged for good, and many registered dietitian nutritionists have been taking advantage of this love by using blogging platforms to educate the public. These blogs must be not only accurate, but also must be fun and engaging so that the reader will be encouraged to read on. 

Learning to make an accurate and engaging blog post about food is an important step in the education of a future dietitian. As such, you may be required to post at least once on your own blogging platform for a class assignment. It is helpful for your first blog post to be done under the supervision of a professor, so that you will have a safe space in which to develop and practice this skill, and so you may receive constructive feedback from professors and peers. The purpose of this document is to help you with the setup of your very first blog post, so that you may focus your energy on finding a compelling topic rather than spending hours trying to figure out how to use the blogging platform as I did when I wrote my first food blog.

## Step One: Chosing your Topic
This may seem like a self explanatory step, and to some extent it is, but there are a few things to consider when chosing your topic that you may not have thought of yourself. 

1. When chosing your topic, you first want to consider the audience that you are writing to. What will they want to read about? What sort of information will be helpful for them to know? For example, my first blog post was written for a class I took in Spring of 2018 when I was a junior at college. The blog post was about making good food choices in the cafeteria, something that my peers at school were particularly concerned about. If you are having issues deciding on a topic, just think, what would I want to read about? If you do lots of research about food for your classes, maybe consider looking through your search history to see what topics are relevant to you at the time. Chances are, what you are interested in learning about is something that your peers or your audience may want to know about as well.

## Step Two: Finding a Blogging Platform
Once you decide on your topic, you next need to find somewhere to write up your assignment. There are several good, **free** blog platforms, like my personal favorite, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/create/?sgmt=gb&utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=Google_WPcom_Search_Brand_Desktop_US_en&utm_medium=cpc&keyword=word%20press&creative=264325718114&campaignid=998785131&adgroupid=53026926367&matchtype=e&device=c&network=g&targetid=kwd-488010762432&locationid=9023724&gclid=Cj0KCQjwlqLdBRCKARIsAPxTGaUT8_oCtkHuC1P8CIAz5rSKRPChFE0azQfxdaZJ1b7A0aKJrepy0KwaAoxXEALw_wcB). I like this platform because it has easy set up, I know it is reliable, and you do not have to have any knowledge of coding in order to set up your page. If you decide [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/create/?sgmt=gb&utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=Google_WPcom_Search_Brand_Desktop_US_en&utm_medium=cpc&keyword=word%20press&creative=264325718114&campaignid=998785131&adgroupid=53026926367&matchtype=e&device=c&network=g&targetid=kwd-488010762432&locationid=9023724&gclid=Cj0KCQjwlqLdBRCKARIsAPxTGaUT8_oCtkHuC1P8CIAz5rSKRPChFE0azQfxdaZJ1b7A0aKJrepy0KwaAoxXEALw_wcB) is not for you, simply hop on over to your favorite search engine and do what you do best: ask the internet for help. Once you do all the tedious work of setting up your account, you can now move on to the fun part: decorating your blog.

## Step Three: Aesthetics
Not only is aesthetics a fun word to say, but at least for me, it was my favorite step of the blog-setting-up process *(besides the actual writing, of course)*. To make something aestetically pleasing just means to make it beautiful, and having a beautiful blog is an important part of actually getting people to read it. I don't know about you, but I am highly likely to skip over any information that is presented in plain text, no matter how useful it is. Remember-even though you may be writing to college students, no one wants to read a blog that looks like a textbook. 
When beautifying your blog, you can go as simple or as crazy as you want *(hint: you want the look of the blog to draw in your desired reader, so keep that in mind when designing your page)*. This is your time to get creative and create something that you're really proud of, but don't get so focused on this part that you neglect the content of your blog. One way of quickly making a beautiful banner or logo for your blog is to use an online graphic design website like [Canva](https://www.canva.com). There are many different templates to choose from on this website, so you can throw together something pretty and focus in on the meat of your blog: the content. Which brings us to the next step...

## Step Four: Writing Something Actually Interesting
The time has come. You have picked a cool topic, you have set up the prettiest blog, and now you are sitting in front of your laptop with a giant, steaming mug of tea and you think... what now?
