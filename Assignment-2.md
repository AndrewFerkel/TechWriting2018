# Assignment Two

## by Lindsey Whitford

My topic for the second assignment is specific diets, focusing on fad dieting (Ketogenic, Atkins, etc). I'm going to focus in on the Ketogenic diet for the assignment. The first post will be a general overview of the diet, the second will be science behind it, and the following will either be more info on the Keto diet or a new diet and a look at the science of it. If I were to maintain this blog past the assignment, I could find plenty of material on the diets with new opinions, celebrities who are doing the diet, and new science on the diet. There are also new fad diets practically all the time, so I think I would have plenty of content to maintain a blog for quite some time.
