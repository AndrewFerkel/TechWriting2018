# Why Would I Want To Eat Like A Bunch of Old Greek Dudes?

## A Brief Introduction into the Mediterranean Diet

If you tend to follow diet trends at all, or even just have access to the outside world, you have likely heard of the Mediterranean diet. The point of the Mediterranean diet is to eat like people ate in [1960s Italy and Greece](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan), which supposedly is great for your [heart and health in general](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801). 

Even though everyone and their dog has *heard* of this magical, fish-filled diet, I doubt many of you have any clue exactly what the diet entails. Well, today is your lucky day! 

## Before I get too deep into Mediterranean, here is a quick overview of what this diet offers:

**1. Plants and plants and fish and plants**


>>The Mediterranean diet is *really* into plants. If you decide to take on this popular diet, you will find yourself [munching on a lot of fruit and veg](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801). Other markers of this diet include its emphasis on lean animal proteins like poultry and fish (you're supposed to have these at least twice a week), avoidance of dairy and red meat, and swapping out your favorite fats for healthier ones like olive or canola oil.
