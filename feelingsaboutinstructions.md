# The Time I Tried to Put Together a Toy Car
## By Lindsey Whitford

My family started out quite large to being with, and has only expanded with the addition of spouses and children. Because of the numerous amounts of immediate family members, my mother has elected to meet once a month to celebrate all birthdays of that month rather than meet for each individual birthday. It was during one of these bulk birthday celebrations that I was tasked with assembling a large Fisher Price toy car for my nephew, who had just turned 2 years old.
The car would have been assembled before the party, but I had put it off until then because that's just who I am."Besides, how hard can it be to assemble a toy car?" I thought foolishly. 

It was like the instructions were in a magical toyland language. They were gleefully illustrated with poorly drawn representations of each of the pieces, only adding to my confusion. For some unknown reason, Fisher Price was under the impression that the person assembling the car would be illiterate, and therefore unable to read simple instructions. Fisher Price must have also assumed that the reader of instructions would be a master of geometric shapes, and would be able to distinguish the tiniest differientiating detail. Plainly said, the instructions were comprised of only grainy black and white pictures of similar looking objects, with no color to differientiate.

Finally, with the help of my sister and our combined previous knowledge of toy cars, the plastic automobile was together. Seeing the joy on my young nephew's face as he purposefully crashed into everything in his path made the brief moment of frustration worthwhile. Though this story has a happy ending, I shall never forget that faithful mid-afternoon of assembling that dang toy car.
