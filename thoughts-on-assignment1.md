# Thoughts on Assignment 1

I thought that assignment 1 went very well for me. Once I figured out how to work github and Markdown and how to insert pictures, it was simply a matter of writing (which I enjoy). I know that there was one section that I forgot to include in my project, but that can be easily fixed for the next assignment by reading the rubric more carefully. 

I was unsure as to whether my content fit the assignment requirements. Creating a blog doesn't *seem* like it should be an especially technical process, but at least the first time I did it, I had a lot of trouble with the set up. I think my document could be helpful to people who take Nutrition Care and Counseling in the future (that was the class that had the blogging assignment) and possibly to people not very comfortable with computer "stuff".

In summary, I did not find this project very difficult once I learned how to work the programs, and I had fun creating my instructional, but I am worried that my topic was not technical enough.
