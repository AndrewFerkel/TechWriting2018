So I *really* like C.S. Lewis, so here's a quote from him

>We are not living in a world where all roads are radii of a circle and where all, if followed long enough, will therefore draw gradually nearer and finally meet at the centre: rather in a world where every road, after a few miles, forks into two, and each of those into two again, and at each fork, you must make a decision.

**ISN'T THIS MAN SO AMAZING AND SMART?!?!?**

That's all I got for now. *Goodbye*
