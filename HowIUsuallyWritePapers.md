# How I Usually Write Papers
## By Lindsey Whitford
The first thing I do in order to write a paper is to *brainstorm*. This usually happens in my head, but I do generally write down each of my thesis, each of my paragraphs and topical sentences, and check with someone to make sure the order of my paper makes sense.

Next I write a rough draft. Depending on how soon the paper is ***due***, I may spend anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours per page. The final draft may either look very similar to the rough draft or very different, again dependent on how long I spend on the rough draft. 

Once I get to the reference page, I tend to spend a lot of time on [Purdue Owl](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/purdue_owl.html) to figure out formatting of APA citation, because I **can never remember how**

And finally, I fill in spaces with *on topic* quotes, like this one:
>“What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.” 
― J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye 

That's really more about books, but you get the point

And that is *basically* all I do to write a paper. Some other things I do when writing papers:

- Snack
- Netflix
- Complain
