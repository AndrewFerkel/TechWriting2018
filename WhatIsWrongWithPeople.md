People are criticizing [Revolve](https://www.thisisinsider.com/category/revolve?utm_source=msn&utm_medium=referral), an online retailer, for [selling a sweatshirt that seems to promote fat shaming.](https://www.thisisinsider.com/category/revolve?utm_source=msn&utm_medium=referral) The sweatshirt, which is designed by the brand LPA, reads "Being fat is not beautiful. It's an excuse."

The $168 "Paloma Sweatshirt" is currently listed as sold out on Revolve's website. But on Wednesday, the retailer faced swift backlash over the product. 

[Fashionista.com](https://fashionista.com/) deputy editor [Tyler McCall](https://twitter.com/eiffeltyler/) pointed out the hypocrisy in the garment. "Revolve thinks its okay to market this sweatshirt-which only comes up to an XL, by the way-by putting it on a thin model?" they wrote. "Considering Revolve doesn't even have diverse influencers this is...A Choice."

Model and activist [Tess Holliday](https://www.thisisinsider.com/category/tess-holliday?utm_source=msn&utm_medium=referral) called the brand "a mess".

## But LPA says it's not what it looks like.

LPA has since responded
